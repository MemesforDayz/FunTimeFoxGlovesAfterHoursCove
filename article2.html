    <div class="columns">
      <p>Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a local pizzaria/arcade, has just gone through a large renovation. For the past <span style="color: black; background-color: black;">7</span> years, Freddy's has been in a progressively worsening state. Until now!</p>

      <p>For the past month Freddy's has made a miraculous comeback. Going from a dilapidated ghost ship, to a clean and family ready restaurant.</p>

      <p>The secret? A new employee working the night shift. This employee, who's requested to be left anonymous, has reportedly been cleaning and repairing sections of the restaurant during his night shifts.</p>
